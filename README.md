# Malaria Prediction and Antimalarial Drug Discovery Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data science projects focused on malaria research, predictive analytics, and antimalarial drug discovery.It includes work on NDHS-based malaria prevalence modeling, QSAR analysis, and scientific computing using Python.
Projects Included
1. Malaria Prevalence Prediction (NDHS Dataset)
   Machine learning models developed to predict malaria infection patterns using:
   - Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) datasets
   - Features from household surveys, children biomarker data, environmental and demographic predictors
   - Supervised ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)
Includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- EDA and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance interpretation and visualization
2. QSAR Modeling for Antimalarial Drug Discovery
Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) workflows for predicting antiplasmodial activity of chemical compounds.
 Includes:
 - Molecular descriptors generation
 - Data normalization and preparation
 - ML models for compound activity prediction
 - Model validation (Y-randomization, cross-validation)
 - Visualization (PCA, feature importance, applicability domain)

Technologies & Tools
This repository uses:
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- RDKit (for QSAR-related projects)
- Git & GitHub for version control
